# OperaBOT

> A simple API Server for unify multiples chats sources in one way. It use [WA_Server proyect](https://gitlab.com/jmdelafuente/_node_wa_server) and [FACE_Server proyect](https://gitlab.com/San-ti/_node_face_server) for messengers services.

## FAQ

- **Is this app built with NodeJS?**

  Yes, it's built with [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) on backend and SocketIO for frontend communication. Please see the [Technologies](#technologies) section for more info.

- **What boilerplate did you use?**

  None. The idea was to get a better understanding of how things work together, But I do take a cue from other projects. Some Design Patterns are being used.

- **..but why? This doesn't exists already?**

  This solution is already provided by some companies but, I'm Argentinian and U$S and Euros are too expensive to pay for it. So, here is my free solution if you need it (as my employer needed it!).
